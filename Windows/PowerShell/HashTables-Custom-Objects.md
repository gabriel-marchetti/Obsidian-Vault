HashTables are structures that are concerned with keys -> values pair which is pretty good to use.

The way we initialize a HashTable:
```powershell
$myHashTable=@{
	"Sabrina"=8.4
	"Gabriel"=5.0
}
```
Here we have an example of name affiliated with grades over a semester.
OBS: The way it prints is by an ordering method.
