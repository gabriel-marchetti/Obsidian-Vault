-> Algorithms: Is a well defined order of actions that will consistently perform a task.

---
Computer Networks: Uses much of the concept of shortest paths algorithms

Cryptography: Relies much on number-theory

Computer Graphics: Needs the primitive algorithms developed by some geometry computation

Databases: Rely on balanced search tree data structures

Computational Biology: Uses much of dynamic programming to find some interesting results

Everyone knows the Moore's Law - which tells us that the density of transistors located in an integrated circuit will double every 1 to 2 years - but most of the complexity issues is solved by utilizing a more syiu
