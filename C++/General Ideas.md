C++ suffered from it's own paradigm which is "The developer doesn't pay for what they don't use". In practice, the developer must pay more attention to the dependencies. 

A general knowledge for c++ workflow is:
-> Arithmetic 
-> Boolean Algebra
-> Drawing Flowcharts
-> Representation of Numbers in Different Systems.

# Mainly uses of C++
-> High performance.
-> Low memory Consumption.

1) **GAMES**
	C++ provides procedural programming over CPU-intensive functions. It is able to provide a efficient environment for 3D Games and Multiplayer networking.
2) **GUI-Based Applications.**
	Some examples of it are Photoshop and Illustrator.
3) **Database Software**
	MySQL and Postgres are both written in C++
4) **Operating Systems**
	C++ has a wide variety of system level functions, which provides more ground to OS development.
5) **Browser Rendering**
	Since it needs to be fast.
6) **Advanced Computation and Graphics**
	Image Processing, real-time physical simulation, mobile sensor application and so on.
7) **Libraries**
	Most high-level languages that support machine-learning usually use C++ for math related problems.
8) **Embedded Systems**
	C++ is used in development of Smart-Watches and Various Types of medical machines.
